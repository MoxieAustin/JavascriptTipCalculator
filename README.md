# JavascriptTipCalculator
I utilized Bootstrap and Vanilla Javascript to create a tip calculator.

To use: 
1. Enter the bill you received as a number.
2. Select the percentage amount that you would like to tip.
3. Press the submit button to view what you your tip and final bill amount should be. 

Enjoy!
